# Quarto Clean Theme - Forked Version

This repository hosts a forked version of the [Quarto clean presentation theme](https://github.com/grantmcdermott/quarto-revealjs-clean). The original theme was designed by [Grant McDermott](https://grantmcdermott.com/). Although I have introduced a few minor modifications for personal use, the essence and aesthetic of the presentation remain closely aligned with the original design. You can view the modified version of the presentation [here](https://danilofreire.github.io/quarto-presentation/).

## Modifications

The modifications made to the original Quarto Clean theme include:

- Adjustments to the color scheme to better suit personal branding.
- Font changes for improved readability and visual appeal.

These changes are minor and aim to maintain the integrity and beauty of the original theme while providing some personalization.
